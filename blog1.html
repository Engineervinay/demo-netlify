        <h1 class="hero-heading">Title:-<span class="hero-heading-inside"> What is AGI & ANI</span></h1>

        <p>Artificial intelligence is one of the most trending topics in the
            technology field right now, let's see first what is artificial
            intelligence in simple terms. AI is a branch of computer science
            that refers to programming machines to think like humans so they
            can perform a certain task or a machine that can learn or make
            decisions on its own.</p>
        <p>Then what is ANI & AGI?
            There are three main types of AI :
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Artificial Narrow Intelligence( ANI )

            </li>
            <li>
                Artificial General Intelligence( AGI )
            </li>
            <li>
                Artificilal Super Intelligence ( ASI )
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So here we are only going to talk about important ones's ANI and
            AGI, because ASI is a big topic and most of the part of it is
            unexplored yet, maybe we will talk about it later.</p>
        <h3>Artificial Narrow Intelligence ( ANI ):</h3>
        <p>
            Artificial Narrow Intelligence is the most important and
            successful type of Artificial intelligence, it is an Intelligence which
            prominent in performing a single task in which AI outperforms
            humans in some very narrow task. And maybe it doesn’t sound
            cool to many people but you’ll like it when you get to know more,
            Because we are using it right now in our day to day life and many
            companies are investing in and implementing ANI to improve
            efficiency, cut costs, and automate tasks. Most ANI tasks are
            obtained by machine learning algorithms.
        </p>
        Let’s see the examples of ANI :
        <ul>
            <li>Self-Driving Cars </li>
            <li> Facial Recongnition Tools</li>
            <li> Virtual Assitants</li>
            <li>Recommendation SystemsSpam Filters </li>
            <li>Speech Recognition </li>
        </ul>




        <h3>Artificial General Intelligence ( AGI ):</h3>
        <p>
            AGI as the name suggests is General intelligence or human-like
            intelligence as you have already seen JARVIS in “Iron Man”, it's
            the future of AI. It allows the machine to apply skills and
            knowledge in different contexts. It can do many tasks and unlike
            ANI it can learn and improve.
            There is much research going on to obtain AGI, and some of the
            AI experts are also said that maybe it cannot be achieved in the
            next 50 years because human consciousness is one of the miracles
            of nature, but some of the experts think it would happen before
            2060.</p>
